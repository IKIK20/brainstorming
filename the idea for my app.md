# brainstorming

I have decided to make a fitness and wellness app that would encourage people to eat healthily and stay fit.
To avail the benenfits on this app, one must sign in with google identification and then log in with the same. 
We would then ask you to create your profile so that we can see how to better help you. 
We would then calculate your BMI and see how often you need to eat, how long you need to sleep and then set reminders accordingly
I think this app could help many people struggling with such problems
